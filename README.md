terum (Computer Science Museum)
=====

Design a virtual museum dedicated to the Faculty of Computer Science (FII). This Web-based museum will 
contain several places ("rooms") providing the most important information about certain aspects (history, 
professors, graduates, students, events, academic programs, etc.). The user interaction will consider 
mobile devices, too.
